# MathsCanvas Structured Approach

**Project Name:** MathsCanvas - Your Personal Graphing Tool

**Overview:** MathsCanvas is a web-based application that allows users to graph mathematical expressions. This project aims to create a graphing calculator where users can create, save, load, edit, and delete graphs.

**Inspiration:** Desmos, Wolfram Alpha

**Objectives:**

- Develop a web application that allows users to create, save, load, edit, and delete graphs of mathematical expressions.
- Implement user authentication to ensure users have secure access to their list of graphs.
- Design an intuitive UI with a clean and modern look.

**Minimum Viable Product (MVP):**

1. User registration, login, and authentication.
2. Create, save, load, edit, and delete graphs.
   - Supports common functions (polynomials, trigonometric, exponential, logarithmic, etc).
3. User dashboard with graph overview.
4. Zoom and pan graphs.

**Optional Features (Stretch Goals):**

1. Respond to change in screen size.
2. Customise graphs.
3. Save and load customisations.
4. Visualise tangent line of selected point of graph.
   - Provide equation of tangent line.
5. Display coordinates of points that are hovered over.
6. Change password.
7. Graph multiple expressions simultaneously.
8. Share graphs.
9. Handle basic mathematical operations like a regular calculator.

**Tech Stack:**

- **Frontend JavaScript Framework:** React.js
- **CSS Framework:** Bootstrap
- **Backend Programming Language:** Node.js (JavaScript)
- **Backend JavaScript Library:** Socket.io (it is said that if I want real-time graphing, I should consider integrating WebSocket technology)
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Deployment:** Heroku Free Tier

## 1 Purpose and Audience

### 1.1 Purpose

The mathematics MathsCanvas will visualise is Calculus.

### 1.2 Audience

The target users are anyone interested in maths.

## 2 Key Features

### 2.1 Interactive Graphing

- Allow visualisation of functions.
  - Based on user input.
    - Has support for common functions (polynomials, trigonometric, exponential, logarithmic).
  - Can be zoomed and panned.

### 2.2 Derivative Visualisation

- Allow visualisation of the derivative of the original function.
  - Appears on the same graph as the plot for the original function.
  - Has a different colour to the plot for the original function.
  - Is concealable.
- Allow visualisation of the tangent line of a selected point of the graph.
  - Provides the equation of the tangent line and its slope.

### 2.3 Customisation Options

- Allow recolour of function and derivative plots, and background colour.
- Allow adjustment of thickness of lines representing functions.
- Allow grid line customisation (colour, thickness, style, spacing, concealability).

### 2.4 Responsive Design

- Adapt flexible grid-based layout to different screen sizes.
- Scale images and graphical elements correctly within their containing elements.
- Apply different styles based on device's screen (Bootstrap, media queries).
- Control layout on mobile browsers by setting viewport meta tag.
- Have components adjust their size and positioning based on screen size.

### 2.5 User Accounts and Authentication (Stretch Goal)

- Allow creation of accounts using username, email, and password.
- Allow accounts to be logged in.
- Use token-based authentication to ensure secure access to user data and features.
- Allow passwords to be changed.

### 2.6 Saving Custom Visualisations (Stretch Goal)

- Allow custom graph settings, functions, and their visualisations to be saved.
- Allow custom graph settings, functions, and their visualisations to be loaded.
- Allow functions and their visualisations to be viewed, edited, or deleted. -->
